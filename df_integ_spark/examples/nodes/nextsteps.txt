Next steps to do in spark integration in  order of priority
1. Integrate https://github.com/mmr-infoworks/spark-examples to awb repo 
   into feature/spark branch
2. Add more test case 
   Fix ResultCheckHelper for adding helper function for float data type
   especially for
   Join :   Try complex joins with advanced expression left outer , right outer etc 
   Groupby : Complex advance groupbys, understand supported aggregation functios 
   Derive  : Similar to above
   Column Rename

3.Tests are currently running with Junit Runner  . Try to change this to PowerMock runner as with 
  other awb test classes. ( I ran into some issues . You will need to google)
